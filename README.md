# ConciergeOfMedia

Picture this, there's a series you want to read or watch. You go on google and type the name of the series, the options are hidden because they're not exactly favourable. On top of that you have to look through several sites to find the one series you really wanted. 

Now you don't have to do that anymore, you just type the name of the series and this web app will search through several websites that I've written data harvesters for, find a match, and return it from every single one of the websites, click on the comic or series or movie you want and you're taken to the page where you can view the content.

Eventually there will be a download button as well, and hopefully a more efficient way for me to crack the safety of every single one of those websites out there. If your website is on the list, try CF, doubt it'll help you from my web crawlers, but you can try.
